## Installation

The package can be installed by adding `code_frame` to your list of
 dependencies in `mix.exs`:

def deps do
  [{:code_frame, "~> 0.1.0"}]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/code_frame](https://hexdocs.pm/code_frame).
